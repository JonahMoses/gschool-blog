Next week we'll have our first assessments. What will be your weak spots, and what will be strong?


<p>We started working with Sinatra this week. Sinatra is a simplified smaller type of Rails framework. This was also our first introduction to building a web application. I find my self having much bigger or maybe just perceived as bigger wins when I get something working. I think this is partly due to me being able to actually see a change happening after I make it. This has also refocused me on the reasons why I decided to come to gSchool. I love doing this stuff. While there are many bumps and bruises that happen along the way of this learning process I am accepting that everyone learns at different paces and that I am in fact learning, so overall I'm happy!</p>
<p>Last week during our focus week was a great time for me to go in and explore the code I had been writing and focusing on what each aspect is doing. I feel it started to solidify my decisions on what I was doing with me code and getting me closer to a point of being comfortable writing it myself. While I don't feel like I'm currently there yet, I feel like I can almost see a tiny spec of light at the end of the tunnel. This light at the end of the tunnel is me being able to code up things myself! I don't believe I've strayed from what I focused on during focus week because the content I was focusing on was being able to do things, I feel like I've been doing things so I think overall it was a very good thing to take that week and focus on the basics.</p>
<p>Working on an individual project is still a bit of a challenge for me. While I possibly could have gotten to the point I am currently at now in IdeaBox by working 100% alone, I think it would have taken me substantially longer. Having a small group to bounce ideas off of and talk through issues tends to be cutting my "stuck" time dramatically down. So while I don't think I'm fully there doing this alone I feel like working in these small teams is really helping me get to that point.</p>
<p>So next week we have our first assessment, while this is incredibly terrifying, its also welcoming. I really like having some one smarter than me notice where my areas of focus need to be and helping me achieve those. I'm interested to see what happens, again like I said, coding by myself is still very touchy and my brain doesn't seem to think up the same ideas in the way that I am while working with a partner so I'd like to see how far along I get with the assessment. Either way I'm here to learn as much as possible and this will give me a good opportunity to see really where I'm at in regards to where they think I should be at, so I'm excited for that</p>
