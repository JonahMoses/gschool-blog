This week a project was introduced to us called EventReporter. The idea behind this project was to be able to 'load' a specified CSV file. The CSV file would include data for a bunch of people who attended an event, including: name, phone, address, registration date, etc.
</p>
<p>
Once the file is loaded into the app we are able to 'find' data from the CSV by the various variables given (name, phone, address, registration date, etc). Once we search the file for specific data, ie: find first name John, the app would search through the file and pull anybody with the first name equalling John and store it into a 'queue'. 
</p>
<p>
Once the data has made it into the queue we have a few different options of what we could do with it. 'queue print' would enable us to print out any information that is currently stored within our 'queue'. 'queue save to' would allow us to export any information from the queue to a designated file.
</p>
<p>
This would proved to be especially time consuming. I wanted to make sure that I was 100% familiar with the contents and fully understanding what I need to. I felt I needed to put in the extra hours necessary as to not fall behind. I could guestimate that I spent roughly somewhere between 70-90 hours here at school. Hours tend to be anywhere from 6-7am to 8pm-3am. On this project I tried to work with others as I feel I'm much more comfortable doing that however I realized I work alone a substantial amount. Unfortunately I don't feel like I'm fully grasping this so when I'm working alone I get stuck and spend hours accomplishing nothing.
</p>
<p>
The project was assigned Monday afternoon and I frivilously worked late that night as well as Tuesday & Wednesday night. I started to feel like I was making some progress and seeing some things come together. Still only making Step 1 of many actually work. Thursday morning when the project was due the teachers decided to extend it to have us work on it more. Which drastically helped me because I felt as if nothing was actually done, and that I was falling behind.
</p>
<p>
The devastating news. After what felt to be about 36 hours straight of working on this project I was told that how I built it that I wouldn't be able to complete it and had to start from scratch. This was unbelievably crushing. So on Thursday after the project was originally due, I had to start from zero again.
</p>
<p>
After starting from zero I realized that either my confidence or what had been completely crushed and have been completely unable to come up with ANY solutions since then. I've tried to rebuild and for whatever reason I'm just not understanding what to do or how to do it. So as of this point on Friday, the day after the project was due, I'm completely at the same point as where I was when the project first got assigned.
</p>
<p>
I would love to provide a link to my code repository but the unfortunate thing is that I don't have any code....
</p>
<p>
Its always hardest to reflect on what worked and what I'd do the next time, when I'm still in such bad shape at the moment. I'd say what worked is my dedication and determination to figure this out. What I'd do next time is ask for help engineering so that I don't run into an issue 20+ hours later.
</p>
<p>
What didn't work? besides everything? Things that especially didn't work well were my ability to thing of the solutions and coding while I'm working alone. When I'm with a partner I feel like together we are able to come up with functional solutions. However while I'm working alone I come up with absolutely nothing. Which makes me think that while I'm working with a partner I'm not doing anything anyways. Again doubting my abilities to accomplish anything.
</p>
<p>
To end things off I'm struggling internally with this complete and utter overwhelming feeling of complete and 100% failure. To make it even harder I am seeing people succeed and move forward which makes me feel good for them, but drives my feelings of inability even farther down.
