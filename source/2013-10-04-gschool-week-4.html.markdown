Here we are, 1 month in!!! wow. It sure has been a crazy ride. I've been enjoying it as much as I possibly can while still maintaining focus on the end goal: be a solid ruby developer. This past week or two we were assigned a project with a partner. Unfortunately I think my partner was having some troubles at the time and didn't seem interested in working in a group, or maybe just wasn't interested in work with me :(. Either way this exponentially increased the difficulty of the project for me. I've noticed through our morning exercises that if I'm left alone and given a problem is extremely difficult for me to get my ideas on thoughts transformed into code. However if I'm paired with some one and bouncing ideas back and forth I tend to be able to get much farther along than my previous attempt by my self. I'm not exactly sure why that is but I'm really interestd in trying to figure out a way to solve that. I'd like to be completely self sufficient.
Due to this inability to work by myself I feel I'm tremendously more productive with a partner.

If you had asked me prior to getting into gSchool what I would have known/mastered after 4 weeks I probably would have told you, "just above basic terminal knowledge". However this is absolutely not the case, we have covered so much ground in 4 weeks its incredible to think that its only been 4 weeks. I feel I have a solid understanding of the basics of the ruby langauge, my struggle now is to be able to call upon that information while I'm alone with a problem.

If I had to guess what/where my skills would be at in 5 months I would have a tough time figuring that out. I'm astonished at how much ground as been covered in 4 weeks, after 5 months who knows whats possible. I really hope that sometime between now and then I'm able to conquer this 'writers block?' that I seem to have and be able to ramp up my learning exponentially. I truly think that will be an excellet adventure to be able to understand it and focus on it more by myself.

The learning strategies that are working best for me are fairly hidden to me. I'm not sure what is working yet. I do know that overloading me with information atop more information atop more information which I may or may not be getting isn't working. I think I need a more solid understanding of the basics to be able to really challenge myself individually and also add more benefit to the group projects.

I've also been told that I'm just being too hard on myself, which might be possible but I'm not as advanced as I'd like to be and thats been pretty consistently frustrating, not sure if thats hindering my progress or not. However I'd really like that frustration hump that I'm currently in to be over. Yet my excitement and optimism hasn't disappeared and is still very much strong and well, excited for whats to come!
