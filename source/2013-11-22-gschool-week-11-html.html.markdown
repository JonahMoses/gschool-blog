  This last week we had a code retreat at iTriage in Denver. They are a coming that hired a few gSchool[0] students and would love to have more. The code retreat was all about building the game battleship, however due to the set time constraints there would be no possible way to finish. This was a bit frustrating but I'm starting to see the benefit of the code retreat model. When you work on something so repetative, you are drilling in focused and repeated practice. This practice is good for learning anything but especially for learning to code as a lot of the "knowing" comes from repatition.

  Going through our Dinner Dash project I began to see the some of the skills I've learned previously start coming out. This was one time where I felt like I was able to contribute and make some things happen. While not as much as I'd like I can now visible see progress which is very exciting!

  We did a focus week on JavaScript and I have to say I really like the things you can do with JS. However I don't understand how such a useful tool can look so ugly when written. Reading a hundred or so lines of Ruby can be understandable, reading through a hundred or so lines of JS can feel like walking through a forest of spiderwebs and tree branches. Basically its not pleasant at all, yet incredibly useful.

  I feel like JS is making sense I've done a bunch of the jQuery tutorials as well but now I'm really interested exploring real world possibilities with it. Recently I went back to Dinner Dash with Simon and we added ajax so that when you add an item to your cart it gives you a flash notice "added to cart" below the button. While not the entertaining, very useful since we made it so the page doesnt reload and you can continue browsing the products from where you were at.
